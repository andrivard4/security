#When the user creates the account, we create a public and private key with it
#The private key is then encrypted and stored in ~/.securedrop/private.pem
#That file is encrypted with a key generated by the user's password and salt
#We can assume the key is decrypted already from MS2 and stored as a global variable private_key
#Use that private key to decrypt the contact data (basically undo what was done in the encrypt portion)
#once that is done we can parse the data as a JSON file (use python's json library)
#This all only needs to be done if the file exists yet... so check that first (the file should be at ~/.securedrop/contacts.log)
